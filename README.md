#Trading Ship Game

This is a game where the player can travel from one port to the next buying or selling commodities.

##how the game will play...
The play will be able to click a button to travel to the next port.
Buy up to four commodities to take to the next Port.
Sell commodities (paying the landing tax).

The commodities currently are Fertilizer, Cereal, Tools and Booze.

In the future, there will be events that occur randomly on travelling making the cost of commodities change in different ports, and maybe events that occur durig travelling to the next port. Prices will also change depending on how rare a commodity is.

I made a first attempt at mocking it up in Codepen.io then exported it and imported it via bash.
